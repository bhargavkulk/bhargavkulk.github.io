This blog post is _hopefully_ the start of me keeping track of what I am doing,
learning, and accomplishing during my PhD.

This blog and the website as a whole is built from scratch, that's right no
static site generators ðŸ˜¤. I use [Djot](https://djot.net/) as my markup
language, and [Mako](https://www.makotemplates.org/) as my templating engine as
choice. I don't like how widely-used static site generators either use a markup
language I don't like or a templating engine that I don't like. I always like
writing things from scratch however painful it ends up being. But this wasn't
too bad. Parsing Djot was easy because of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), and
Mako is very easy to use because it's just Python!

I am looking forward to filling this blog up pretty frequently; I already have
one blog cooking up!
