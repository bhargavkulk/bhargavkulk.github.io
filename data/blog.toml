abstract = """Floating point numbers are how we squeeze the infinite world of real numbers \
into a finite space on our computers. As programmers, we use them all the time \
to mimic real-world calculations, often without really thinking about the \
consequences of approximating infinite numbers with finite ones. This can lead \
to some pretty funny and unexpected situations."""
